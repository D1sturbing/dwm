# Patching in more features 

You can find a treasure trove of excellent patches for dwm over at https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/
Credit for those patches goes to their respective authors.
I did not write any of the patches used in this fork from scratch (Shit's complicated, and i'm not a C wizard like the suckless devs or the people who make patches for suckless software.)
